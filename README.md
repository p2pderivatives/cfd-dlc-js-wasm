# cfd-dlc-js-wasm
WASM version of the cfd-dlc-js library

### Build

#### Using docker

WebAssembly does not depend on the execution environment.
You can use it in any environment by building it on Docker.

```
docker-compose build wasm-build
docker-compose up wasm-build
```

- attention
  If you get an error, do the following:
  1. remove external/libwally-core
  2. remove node_modules

## Developper Note

### Git connection:

Git repository connections default to HTTPS.
However, depending on the connection settings of GitHub, you may only be able to connect via SSH.
As a countermeasure, forcibly establish SSH connection by setting `CFD_CMAKE_GIT_SSH=1` in the environment variable.

- Windows: (On the command line. Or set from the system setting screen.)
```
set CFD_CMAKE_GIT_SSH=1
```

- MacOS & Linux(Ubuntu):
```
export CFD_CMAKE_GIT_SSH=1
```

### Ignore git update for CMake External Project:

Depending on your git environment, you may get the following error when checking out external:
```
  Performing update step for 'libwally-core-download'
  Current branch cmake_build is up to date.
  No stash entries found.
  No stash entries found.
  No stash entries found.
  CMake Error at /workspace/cfd-core/build/external/libwally-core/download/libwally-core-download-prefix/tmp/libwally-core-download-gitupdate.cmake:133 (message):


    Failed to unstash changes in:
    '/workspace/cfd-core/external/libwally-core/'.

    You will have to resolve the conflicts manually
```

This phenomenon is due to the `git update` related command.
Please set an environment variable that skips update processing.

- Windows: (On the command line. Or set from the system setting screen.)
```
set CFD_CMAKE_GIT_SKIP_UPDATE=1
```

- MacOS & Linux(Ubuntu):
```
export CFD_CMAKE_GIT_SKIP_UPDATE=1
```
